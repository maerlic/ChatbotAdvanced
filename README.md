Chatbot Knowledge Extraction and Interaction
Overview

This chatbot is designed to extract information from URLs provided by users, save the extracted information to a .txt file, and index the file for efficient chat interactions. By continuously updating the knowledge base with each new URL, the chatbot ensures persistent knowledge retention, overcoming the limitations of context windows seen in traditional models like ChatGPT. This means you won't need to repeatedly paste links or copy old chat history.
Features

    URL Information Extraction: Send a URL to the chatbot, and it will extract the relevant information.
    Persistent Knowledge Base: Extracted information is saved and indexed, ensuring it is retained for future interactions.
    Efficient Interaction: Indexed knowledge allows for fast and accurate responses during chat interactions.
